<!-- 
  This is the public client side

From a HTML5 boiler plate doc, added script.js and css link 
The added two content wrappers called main and sub each given these classes

main
we allow new subscribers to join the mailing list
But if a user has already joined then a <span> inside the paragraph
allows this to change and profive this information to the client side user

sub
Alows us to submit
type is text , possibly could be changed to email?
